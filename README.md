# Discord Stock Bot

This bot runs every (your integer) seconds and checks the link if it is in stock.

This bot is highly customizable to fit your needs. I use it for Canada Computers but it can be used for any website.

To use the bot you will need to create a discord bot in the discord developer portal and invite it to your server, it will need permission to send messages.
To start the bot, fill in the information need in the readBot.py file, autoRun.bat file, botStart.bat file and the main.js file.
Once all the information is filled out, run the autoRun.bat file and it will send notifications to your server whenever it detects the item in stock
